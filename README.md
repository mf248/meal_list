This website was created as a tool for me.  I made a pledge to never eat the same meal at any restaurant more than once.  I decided an excel sheet would be inadequate and boring, so I created this site to keep track of what meals I have ate at which restaurants.  I also want to improve my writing skills so I included a small microblogging element to allow me to talk about each meal.

Feel free to use this website to keep a journal of what you've tried, to start microblogging about your meals, or just to get reviews onto the web.

Best,

Mike
